Revision history Bot::BasicBot

0.61 2005/05/13
  - Fix for the odd behaviour of freenode - we ask the server for the time
    periodically to catch servers that don't send pings.

0.60 2005/03/21
  - Charset support
  - use Text::Wrap to split up really long responses, instead of a
    nasty regexp, so we split on spaces properly.

0.50 2004/12/01 (revision 1366)
  - Real (almost) tests
  - Nick (and op/voice status) tracking
  - Quiet some warnings

  - Fixed 'addressing' typo, thanks Earle
  - Fixed annoying errors for logging
  - Fixed stupid bug where the return value of said wasn't getting said.
    How can I not have noticed?
  - if you don't return true from init, be more helpful.
  - if help doesn't return true, don't say anything
  - Made SYNOPSIS clearer

0.30 2003/01/02
  - Randomized name so you can run more than one at once in one POE session
  - Log a lot less.
