Bot::BasicBot 0.30

SYNOPSIS

Bot::BasicBot is a basic system designed to make it easy to do simple
bots, optionally forking longer processes (like searches) concurrently
in the back-ground.

It's based on POE, but abstracts all of the POE jiggery-pokery as much
as possible, leaving you to just code bots.

INSTALL

The standard install process should work fine:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install (as root)

POE will generate the following warning during the Makefile.PL and
"make test" phases of installation:

POE::Kernel's run() method was never called.

This will hopefully be fixed in a future release, but I'm following
the time-honoured adage "release early, release often" :) And it just
looks untidy, it doesn't affect the install process.

REQUIREMENTS

You need to have POE 0.22 or later installed. Earlier versions don't
include POE::Wheel::Run, or have POE::Wheel::Run with a different
interface, which will break the forking component of the bot.

You also need POE::Component::IRC.
